# **Vulnerability Assessment Report**

## **14 July 2025**

## ---

# **System Description**

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

# **Scope**

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRpdpQMEWskxSkwqEMv8W7A7x8GXQlcn0hEcDzWet3Y/template/preview?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-3GRRWAd8HryVgof-Jc33yA) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

# **Purpose**

The remote database server is invaluable to our e-commerce business as it stores critical customer information, including contact details and purchase history, which our remote employees regularly access to identify leads and drive sales. Securing this data is paramount to maintaining customer trust, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and preserving our company's reputation. If this server were disabled or its data compromised, the business would face severe operational disruption, potential data breaches leading to significant financial penalties, a complete halt in lead generation and sales, and irreversible damage to our brand.

# **Risk Assessment**

| Threat source | Threat event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ***Outsider (Hacker)*** | ***Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration*** | *3* | *3* | *9* |
| ***Outsider (Hacker)*** | ***Alter/Delete critical information*** | *3* | *3* | *9* |
| ***Competitor*** | ***Conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.*** | *2* | *3* | *6* |

| *Standard User (Disgruntled Employee)* | *Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration* | *2* | *3* | *6* |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ***Malicious Software*** | ***Disrupt mission-critical operations.*** | *2* | *3* | *6* |

The risk assessment was carried out in accordance with NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, focusing on threats arising from the database server being publicly exposed. Likelihood was rated based on the high visibility of the vulnerability, and severity was rated based on the potential impact on critical operations, company reputation, and customer trust. The highest risks correspond to external threats that seek to steal or manipulate sensitive data, underscoring the urgent need to implement stricter security controls to protect the organization's assets.

# **Approach**

Our qualitative vulnerability assessment prioritized risks based on the severe exposure of the public-facing database server, focusing on threats with the highest potential impact on our e-commerce operations. We specifically considered **Outsider (Hacker)** threats due to the direct access to sensitive customer data, making exfiltration and data alteration highly probable. **Competitor** threats were included for their potential to disrupt business via Denial of Service, directly impacting revenue. Finally, **Malicious Software** poses a broad threat to operational continuity. This approach ensures high-level business risks are identified, guiding informed decisions on resource allocation and remediation priorities.

# **Remediation Strategy**

To address the critical vulnerabilities identified, particularly the publicly accessible database, a comprehensive remediation strategy must be implemented. Firstly, **IP allow-listing** is paramount to restrict database access solely to corporate offices, preventing unauthorized connections from the internet. Concurrently, enhancing **authentication and authorization (AAA)** mechanisms is crucial, involving the mandatory use of **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** and **role-based access controls** to enforce the **Principle of Least Privilege**, ensuring only authorized personnel have necessary access. Furthermore, ensuring **encryption of data in motion using TLS** will protect data during legitimate remote access, while robust **auditing** will provide visibility for threat detection. These layered controls establish a strong defense-in-depth posture against external and internal threats.
